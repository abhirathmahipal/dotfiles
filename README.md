### `.vimrc`
I've gleefully stripped stuff from the following people.
- [Gokul Srinivas](https://github.com/GokulSrinivas)
- [Shrayas Rajagopal](https://github.com/shrayasr)
- https://ncona.com/2013/01/configuring-vim/

### vimfiles
- `colors`  
    - colourschemes. Vim looks for a directory named `color` for themes.
    - Copy the content to the appropriate directory in Windows and Linux.
    - In Windows Program Files/Vim/vimfiles
    - Fill Linux here as well

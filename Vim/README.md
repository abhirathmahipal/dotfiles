Things to remember when I use vim for the best possible experience.
Also remember to make changes to this file whenever I make changes to my .vimrc
I should quickly be able to come to speed if I need help getting familiar with my
configuration.


### Navigation

#### Easy Motion
- <leader><leader><movement key like w, k, j etc>
- Eg:- \\w gives a one key reach solution for all w's possible

#### 

### Switching Tabs, Buffers, Windows etc

#### Switch or open Buffers, Files etc
#### Most Recent Buffer
- Switch to most recent buffer <leader>e
- Will be used a lot. Eg:- Copying parameters from model to controller and cross file
references.

#### Switch to another Buffer
- Switch to next buffer <leader>n. Keep pressing this combo to go to the next buffer.
- Open up buffer list. Enter a number or partial name to open the relevant
buffer - <leader>b. To be on the safer side you can even enter a name and press 
tab to make use of autocomplete to ensure you get the right match.


#### Switch Tabs
Avoid using tabs. They aren't the Vim way of doing things. Tabs in vim don't mean
the tabs you see on other editors. If you've forgotten what tabs are please read 
about them to gain context.
- Next Tab  Ctrl + PgUp 
- Prev Tab  Ctrl + PgDown



### General Tasks
Select All (Taken from Shrayas)
